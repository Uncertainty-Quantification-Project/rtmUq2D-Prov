      -- migrated seismic sections per shot:
         sectionID.bin, where ID is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., numberOfShots
         exs.: "crossCorrelation000001.bin", "crossCorrelation000002.bin", ...
      
      -- stacked seismic section: summation of the information in the files 
         "crossCorrelation000001.bin" + "crossCorrelation000002.bin" + ...
         This process provides a final stacked section that constains information about
         all shots.
      
      -- filtered stacked seismic section: this file contains the result of applying the 
         Laplacian filter after the summation described.
         This process provides a final stacked section that constains information about
         all shots.

Observation 1:
      
      Each seismic section is a binary file with Nx * Nz information.
      See 0_inputs_readme.INFO to get information about Nx and Nz values.
      
      Each sample of the migrated section represents the seismic amplitude of hydrostatic pressure squared.
