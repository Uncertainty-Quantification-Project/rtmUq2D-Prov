  This website presents the documentation of <b>DfAnalyzer library implemented in C++</b>, which is named as <b>dfa-lib-cpp</b>. 

<h3>DfAnalyzer tool</h3>
<p>DfAnalyzer tool is an instantiation of <a href="https://hpcdb.github.io/armful/index.html" target="_blank">ARMFUL architecture</a> to provide dataflow analysis to scientific applications. By coupling DfAnalyzer components to the source codes of scientific applications, scientific data is extracted and related along a dataflow ready for queries at runtime. DfAnalyzer has features that help monitoring, debugging, provenance registration and steering, all at runtime. Its light components do not harm the parallel performance of the scientific applications. As opposed to SWMS, DfAnalyzer keeps all the parallel execution control at the scientific application code. Therefore, applications may use highly efficient libraries or invoke black-box parallel code.</p>
<p>DfAnalyzer can also be used by computational and computer specialists, so that they can incorporate user steering support. When coupled to <a href="https://github.com/hpcdb/DfAdapter" target="_blank">DfAdapter</a>, provenance of human interaction data is collected when users adapt a dataflow online (while it is in execution), relates with other data of interest and makes the provenance database available for online analytical queries. Example of possible adaptations are: parameter tuning, dataset reduction, loop changes, etc.</p>

<h3>C++ library: <i>dfa-lib-cpp</i></h3> 

<p>dfa-lib-cpp consists of a DfAnalyzer library implemented in C++ for extracting provenance data, extracting raw data from data sources, and generating indexes of extracted data at runtime based on the usage of DfAnalyzer RESTful services. To do that, dfa-lib-cpp uses the following DfAnalyzer components presented below: <i>Provenance Data Extractor</i>, <i>Raw Data Extractor</i>, and <i>Raw Data Indexer</i>. In this case, HTTP requests are sent by dfa-lib-cpp using curl library to the DfAnalyzer RESTful server, which registers provenance and domain data in our database during the execution of scientific applications. More details about this library can be found in this documentation.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>
<h4>Provenance Data Extractor</h4>
Provenance Data Extractor (PDE) consists of a RESTful API that manages dataflow at physical (i.e., file flow) and logical (i.e., data flow) levels. By receiving HTTP requests, PDE captures provenance and scientific data from scientific application codes or workflows modeled on SWMS, generating a JSON object (kept in memory) with the gathered data and their data dependencies. We highlight that the JSON object generated by PDE presents a hierarchical structure to be in accordance with the dataflow concepts presented in our CCPE paper published in 2016. Besides provenance and scientific data capture, PDE also loads these data in DfAnalyzer's provenance database for enabling online query processing.

<h4>Raw Data Extractor</h4>
Before to send retrospective provenance data (scientific data from the execution of scientific application) using PDE program, users have to access and extract scientific data from raw data files. Therefore, Raw Data Extractor (RDE) is a binary program that provides raw data extraction from files. To run this program, users have to define the following input arguments:

<h4>Raw Data Indexer</h4>
Besides the raw data extraction, there are some approaches that index raw data from files to reduce the volume of data to be loaded into an external repository or a database, such as FastBit, NoDB, RAW, and SDS/Q. Raw Data Indexer (RDI) has the same input arguments of RDE program, however this program generates indexes to the extracted scientific data from files. RDI binary program presents some cartridges that use indexing techniques from existing approaches, such as FastBit tool. This program also has a cartridge based on the positional indexing, which considers the RAWâ€™s implementation. In addition, users can also develop new cartridges for applying other indexing techniques in their raw data file formats.
